# music-presence/news

This repository hosts news that are shown in the Music Presence app.

## Contributing translations

You can contribute a translation of a news entry
by following these instructions:

1. Become a Music Presence translator first,
   by following the instructions
   [here](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/blob/master/documentation/translations.md).
2. Open [translate.codeberg.org/projects/music-presence/app-news](https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/music-presence/app-news/)
   which will give you an overview over what is left for translation.
   Once you were invited to the project, you should able to translate right away.

Before starting, keep the following in mind:
- Translations of the "banner" and "title" keys
  are the most important
  (search for "Key" on the page of a translation string),
  as these texts are the first that users read,
  when they see a news popup.
  Translating these is quick and is more than enough.
- If you want to go the extra mile and translate the entire news text,
  then you are more than welcome to do so.
  Please try your best to match the tone of the original news entry.
  Also, please only translate if you are confident in your translating
  of continuous text (rather than individual words).
  If you feel like your translation would not match the original,
  it is okay to leave the news text untranslated.
- Thank you for contributing!

## Attribution of your translations

Since you are already a Music Presence translator,
your translations of the news will be attributed just the same way
as your app translations in the About window of the app.
