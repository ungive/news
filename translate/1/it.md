# News (#1)

> *Translate the text for each category. Only translate text that is **not italic** and which is located between two horizontal bars (---). It is sufficient to translate the banner text and the title of the news. Translating the content of the news is optional. See below for more details.*

## *Banner*

> *Translate the text in the banner by translating the text that you can see below the image. The image is just here for reference, so you can see where the text is located and how long each piece of text should be. Try to ensure that the length of the translation does not exceed the original text or the space that you can see in the image.*

## *Content*

> *Translating the content is entirely **optional**. Only translate this, if you are confident that you can recreate the original tone of the message well. In some cases translations of the content are **not accepted**. Please contact the repository owner first before translating, to make sure that you are not translating this unnecessarily.*
