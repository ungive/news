## Music Presence needs your help

Hello, it's Jonas, the creator of Music Presence!

I want to let you know about the future of the app
and how you can help **keep the project alive**.

You may not know this, but I'm the **only developer**
behind Music Presence. I've put a lot of love into the project
since around May 2024
and I am extremely motivated to keep going,
but due to recent events in my life
I won't have enough time for the project anymore soon.

I am looking for **financial support** from users like you,
so I can work on the following features:

- **last.fm scrobbling**, universal for all operating systems and all media players
- **browser support** to detect media from websites in addition to desktop apps
- **listening along**, so you can sync your music playback to that of your friends

&nbsp;

To help, you can **donate a small amount**,
either on a monthly basis or one time.
My goal is to find enough supporters to sustain a living,
so that I can be independent of a corporate job.

You can find the donation goal and progress on my website:
[**musicpresence.app**](https://musicpresence.app?utm_source=app&utm_medium=news).
There you will also find the
[**project timeline**](https://musicpresence.app#timeline?utm_source=app&utm_medium=news),
[**available donation options**](https://musicpresence.app/donate?utm_source=app&utm_medium=news) and
[**a list of all current sponsors**](https://musicpresence.app/sponsors?utm_source=app&utm_medium=news).

and subscribe to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues/344)

I will inform you whether the goal has been reached on the 10th of August 2025.
