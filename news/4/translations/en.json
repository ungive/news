The notes don't need to be translated.\n- These are translations for the news popup which has a banner image at the top. The banner is the first thing people will look at when they get the news popup. The translation should carry over the same message and the same impression as the original. Take a look at the banner itself first before translating and try to recreate the impression you get.\n- I'm using <em></em> HTML tags for \"emphasis\" because in the banner image the word \"full-time\" is emphasized, it stands out. If it's possible to emphasize a specific word with your translation, then put the <em>...</em> tags around it. Otherwise you can just leave it away, if it doesn't make sense to use it.\n- The months resemble the months at which each feature will be ready: September 2025, October 2025 and January 2026. I've put them in lowercase so they do not stand out as much. If it's appropriate, translate into lowercase as well.\n- Make sure there is space on the banner for the translation (see the attached banner image on the right in Weblate). If not, you may break the text across multiple lines in such a way that it can comfortably fit in its space.\n- If you are ever unsure about a translation, you can always ping me in the #translations channel!\n- It may sometimes not make sense to translate certain words, for instance: \"last.fm scrobbling\" can hardly be translated",
