# Music Presence needs your help

## Music Presence needs your help

**In short:**&nbsp;
To continue development, I need to commit to Music Presence full-time.
I am looking for people who are willing to fund my work.
A small monthly donation can already have a big impact!

&nbsp;

Hello, it's Jonas, the creator of Music Presence!

I am at a point in my life where I need to make a decision:
Focus on a corporate job and have little time left for this project
or fully commit to Music Presence and implement these missing features:

- **last.fm scrobbling**, universal for all operating systems and all media players
- **browser support** to detect media from websites in addition to desktop apps
- **listening along**, so you can sync your music playback to that of your friends

&nbsp;

If you have the time, please take a moment to read my message below.
You can find the donation goal and progress on my website:
  [**https://musicpresence.app**](https://musicpresence.app).
There you will also find the
[**project timeline**](https://musicpresence.app#timeline),
[**available donation options**](https://musicpresence.app/donate) and
[**a list of all current sponsors**](https://musicpresence.app/sponsor).

### Why fund this project?

I want to be very transparent about my plans for Music Presence,
why I am looking for people to fund my work
and what you can expect from me in the near future.

#### About me

In the past year I have put my heart and soul into this project.
I have published
[16 versions](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/releases)
since the initial release,
I am very active on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues)
and on the
[Discord server](https://discord-invite.musicpresence.app),
I reply to all messages I get
and I care for my app to work well for everyone.
Users have [many great things to say](https://musicpresence.app#references) about the app and I have
[big plans](https://musicpresence.app#timeline)
moving forward!

I honestly *cannot wait* to put my mind to it,
but right now my situation does not allow me to do that.
I need to focus on making a living
and I want to at least try to do that with Music Presence
because I believe this app has great potential.
I hope you do too.

#### What you can expect

For a detailed overview of when I plan to release the next features
check out the project timeline on the new Music Presence website:
[musicpresence.app](https://musicpresence.app#timeline)

I will first work on
[last.fm scrobbling](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues/53)
which will be completed in September at the latest.
Anyone who decides to support me financially on a monthly basis
will get early access.
It does not matter how much you donate.

While I collect feedback from you I will already start working on
[browser support](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues/5),
which does not only allow you to detect media from websites
but it also lays the foundation for
[listening along with friends](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues/319).
Browser support will be accomplished with a [custom browser extension](https://github.com/ungive/media-control-extension)
that communicates with the Music Presence app.
Browser support is expected to be here in October or earlier.

Once that is complete
[listening along](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues/319)
is the next milestone &ndash; and it may be the biggest one yet.
The initial implementation will work by controlling a streaming service website
using the browser extension, e.g. the YouTube Music website,
but that is only the beginning.

In 2026 I want to work on an
[open developer platform](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence/issues/318)
where third-party applications can integrate with Music Presence.
This will allow other developers to build tools and plugins for media players,
so that you can e.g. listen along with people directly in your music app.
An open developer platform will open the doors for many more possibilities.

#### Are you convinced?

I hope I was able to paint a clear picture of my vision.
If you have any questions or you want to chat with me directly,
feel free to contact me by joining the

If you do not have the means to support me financially,
you can help me out a lot by sharing the link to my website

Thank you for reading this far. ❤️
