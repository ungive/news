# Upvote Music Presence on Peerlist

## Upvote Music Presence on peerlist.io

I have published Music Presence on
[**peerlist.io**](https://peerlist.io/ungive/project/music-presence),
a weekly leaderboard for aspiring software projects.
This is a great opportunity to get the word out for the app
and to make a mark on a large platform like Peerlist.
5 minutes of your time could make a real difference!
The voting closes on Sunday.

Please leave a review, so we can get Music Presence to the **very top**!
As a thank you,
you get a **special role** on the
[**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/7rc8dWD4ug)
and you can enter the small **giveaway** below!

&nbsp;

## How can you help?

1. Visit **[https://peerlist.io/ungive/signup](https://peerlist.io/ungive/signup)**
2. Continue with Google or enter an e-mail and password
3. Enter your profile information. Using a nickname is perfectly fine
4. Notice the progress at the bottom: "You can't interact yet". Connect one account under the "Work" tab, e.g. your GitHub account and you should be able to interact. Make sure it says you can interact before continuing
5. Now visit the project page: **[https://peerlist.io/ungive/project/music-presence](https://peerlist.io/ungive/project/music-presence)**
6. **Upvote** by clicking the black "Upvote" button
7. **Bookmark** by clicking the flag icon in the top menu, next to the share button
8. **Comment** your experience with Music Presence under "How does this project inspire you?" - You can also upvote a comment of another user, if you resonate with what they wrote, but writing your own comment helps the most!
9. Scroll down for information on the giveaway and Discord role!

## What happens when Music Presence reaches the top 3?

Quoting the [Peerlist FAQ](https://help.peerlist.io/individual/launchpad/frequently-asked-questions-about-spotlight-by-peerlist) on their website:

> *The winners will be featured in Peerlistâ€™s weekly emails and social media channels, providing valuable exposure to the builders. Additionally, the winners will receive a special badge for their products, showcasing their achievements and potentially attracting new opportunities.*

I truly believe we can achieve this. If you don't have time now, please set a reminder for later! Thank you for putting the effort in to help Music Presence grow. Reaching the top 3 would be a big step forward for the future of the app!

&nbsp;
